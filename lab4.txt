1. To give boxes.html a new background color I went into the .css and created a new line 
background-color: green;

2. When changing the border as you increase it the border gets thicker. The width and high was set to 100px.
 I made that 50 and they got smaller.

3. The padding controls the size of the boxes. When it is grater then 100 the boxes are very big and the
 numbers inside of them can move. The margin is the space between each box. The bigger the number the 
 bigger the spaces are between the boxes.

4. When you have alot of text that you want to put in a smaller area you can insert a scroll bar in order 
to fit more on the page and allow the used to scroll through the content. The hidden just has the box and 
then cuts out everything not in the box

5. When you use the float left attribute they are in order from 1,2,3 on the top of the page. When you 
use the float right attribute the are in order 3,2,1 across the top of the page.

6. The relative positive of the boxes when you give them all the float left goes in the order 1,2,3 across the top. 

7. In order to make the shape that we were supposed to. I first floated then all left to get 1,2,3. The next step 
is to use the clear function and if you do clear left on div3 it will clear the content to the left of it leaving you with:
1,2
3

8. Nothing changes the default margin is 0px.
